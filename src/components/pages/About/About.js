            Co-creator and executive producer Mike Judge had worked in a Silicon
            Valley startup early in his career. In 1987, he was a programmer at
            Parallax, a company with about 40 employees. Judge disliked the
            company's culture and his colleagues ("The people I met were like
            Stepford Wives. They were true believers in something and I don't
            know what it was") and quit after less than three months, but the
            experience gave him the background to later create a show about the
            region's people and companies.[7] He recollects also how startup
            companies pitched to him to make a Flash-based animation in the past
            as material for the first episode: "It was one person after another
            going, 'In two years, you will not own a TV set!' I had a meeting
            that was like a gathering of acolytes around a cult leader. 'Has he
            met Bill?' 'Oh, I'm the VP and I only get to see Bill once a month.'
            And then another guy chimed in, 'For 10 minutes, but the 10 minutes
            is amazing!
